I'm transitioning from a non-technical background to biomedical generative AI for biomedical discovery. I'm building expertise in AI/ML engineering, focusing on production-grade LLM applications, AI agents, fine-tuning, pretraining, and scalable ML systems.

Convert the following video transcript into detailed, intuitive Markdown notes in an artifact. Detect the language and topic automatically, but provide notes in English.

**WHAT I ALREADY KNOW:**
[INPUT YOUR EXISTING KNOWLEDGE HERE - Leave empty if learning from scratch. Be specific about:
- Related concepts you understand
- Technologies/tools you're familiar with
- Previous experience with similar topics
- Specific areas where you need more depth vs. areas you can skip
Example: "I understand basic Python and neural networks, but haven't worked with transformers yet" or "I'm familiar with supervised learning but new to reinforcement learning"]

---

**Requirements:**

1. **Adaptive Learning Path**: 
   - If "What I Already Know" is empty: Build from absolute first principles
   - If prior knowledge is specified: 
     * Skip or briefly review concepts already understood
     * Build on existing knowledge as a foundation
     * Focus depth on gaps and new material
     * Make explicit connections to what they already know
     * Use their existing mental models as anchors for new concepts

2. **Intuition-First Explanation**: 
   - Assume no prior technical knowledge unless specified in "What I Already Know"
   - Use analogies, metaphors, and real-world examples (especially biomedical when relevant)
   - Explain the "why" and "how it works" before diving into technical details
   - Build strong mental models and conceptual frameworks
   - Connect abstract concepts to tangible, understandable ideas
   - Bridge from familiar concepts (from "What I Already Know") to new ones

3. **Progressive Complexity**:
   - Start at the appropriate level based on existing knowledge
   - Gradually layer in technical depth
   - Explain jargon and technical terms when first introduced (unless already known)
   - Show the logical progression of ideas
   - Indicate which sections build on stated prior knowledge

4. **Biomedical AI Context**: Connect concepts to applications in:
   - Biomedical discovery and research
   - Drug discovery and development
   - Protein structure prediction and molecular design
   - Medical imaging and diagnostics
   - Clinical data analysis and patient outcomes
   - Literature mining and knowledge graphs
   - Multi-modal biomedical AI systems

5. **Practical Context**: Also connect to general AI/ML applications:
   - LLM-based applications and agents
   - Fine-tuning (SFT, RLHF) and pretraining
   - Production systems and deployment
   - Data processing and model development

6. **Enhanced Learning**: Add insights beyond the video:
   - Why this matters for biomedical AI development
   - Common pitfalls and misconceptions (especially for beginners at your level)
   - Best practices and design patterns
   - How this fits in the broader ecosystem
   - When to use vs. when to avoid
   - Learning resources for deeper understanding (calibrated to your knowledge level)

7. **Visual Aids**: Include diagrams (Mermaid, ASCII, or descriptions) for:
   - Architecture and system design
   - Data flow and processes
   - Relationships between components
   - Conceptual models and mental frameworks
   - Step-by-step workflows
   - Visual bridges between known and new concepts

8. **Code/Command Examples**: Provide:
   - Heavily annotated examples explaining every step (unless basic syntax is already known)
   - Additional practical examples with clear explanations
   - Comparison of different approaches with pros/cons
   - Common variations and their use cases
   - Mistakes to avoid
   - Build on coding patterns already familiar (if specified)

9. **Structure**: Organize with:
   - **Prerequisites Check** (what you need to know - cross-reference with stated knowledge)
   - **Key Takeaways** (at the top)
   - **Knowledge Bridge** (if prior knowledge specified: how new concepts relate to what you know)
   - **Intuitive Overview** (high-level understanding, calibrated to your level)
   - Clear headings and subheadings
   - **Deep Dive** sections for technical details (with depth appropriate to background)
   - **Biomedical AI Applications** (where relevant)
   - **Common Patterns & Best Practices**
   - **Beginner Pitfalls to Avoid** (specific to your knowledge level)
   - **What You Just Learned** (explicit recap of new vs. reinforced concepts)
   - **Summary & Next Steps** (with personalized learning path recommendations)

Generate comprehensive Markdown notes in an artifact that are highly intuitive and actionable for someone transitioning to become an expert in biomedical generative AI. Prioritize building deep understanding over surface-level knowledge. Adapt the explanation depth and starting point based on the "What I Already Know" section.
