# **Python Lecture 1 — Complete Notes**

---

## 🧠 **1. Introduction to Programming**

Programming means **instructing a computer to perform specific tasks** through code.

* **Machine (Hardware)** – Executes tasks.
* **Code (Software)** – The set of instructions written by a programmer.

You write **code** to communicate with your machine.

---

### 🧩 How Communication Works

Computers **do not understand human languages** (Hindi, English, Marathi, etc.).
They only understand **binary (0s and 1s)** — representing **high (1)** and **low (0)** voltage.

Hence, we use **programming languages** (Python, Java, C++, etc.) to communicate with computers.

---

### 💬 Analogy

If you go to France, you must speak **French** to be understood.
Similarly, to “talk” to a computer, you must use a **language the computer understands** → *a programming language.*

---

### 🔄 Translator Concept

Computers can’t directly understand Python code — it’s written in human-friendly syntax.

So, we need a **translator** that converts Python into machine code.

* **Translator types:**

  * **Compiler**
  * **Interpreter**

Python uses an **interpreter**, which translates code **line by line** into machine instructions.

---

### 🪜 Language Levels

* **High-level languages (like Python)** – Easy for humans to read/write.
* **Low-level languages (like Assembly or Machine code)** – Directly understood by the computer.

* **Free & Open Source** – No license cost.
* **High-level language** – Easy to understand, abstracts machine details.
* **Platform independent** – Works across Windows, macOS, Linux.
* **Versatile** – Used in:

  * Machine Learning, Data Science
  * Web Development (Django, Flask)
  * Automation, AI, etc.

## ⚙️ **3. Python Installation**

### On Windows

1. Visit [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Click “Download Python 3.x.x”.
3. Before installing:

   * ✅ Check **“Add Python to PATH”**
   * ✅ Allow admin privileges.
4. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

### On macOS

1. Download `.pkg` file from Python’s official website.
2. Install via the installer.
3. Verify in terminal:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

---

## 🧰 **4. Installing VS Code (Editor)**

1. Search **“Download VS Code”** on Google.
2. Visit: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Choose version (Windows/macOS/Linux).
4. Open VS Code → Create new file → Save as `first_program.py`

---

## 💻 **5. Writing Your First Program**

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

* `print()` → Function that displays text/output on the screen.
* Anything inside quotes `" "` or `' '` is treated as **string**.

You can print anything:

```python
print("My name is Shraddha")
print("My college is XYZ")
```

---

## 📖 **6. Python Program Structure**

A Python program typically:

1. Takes **input**.
2. **Processes** data (calculations, logic).
3. Produces **output**.

### Example

```python
print("Sum of 2 + 3 is:", 2 + 3)
```

Output → `Sum of 2 + 3 is: 5`

---

## 🔡 **7. Python Character Set**

Python accepts characters from:

* `A–Z`, `a–z`
* `0–9`
* Special symbols: `+ - * / % = _`
* Whitespaces (space, tab)
* ASCII and Unicode characters

Characters from other languages (e.g., Hindi, Marathi letters) are invalid in identifiers.

---

## ✍️ **8. Variables**

### Definition

A **variable** is a name that stores a value in memory.

Think of it as a *labeled box* in memory that holds data.

```python
name = "Shraddha"
age = 23
price = 25.99
```

Here:

* `name` → string variable
* `age` → integer variable
* `price` → floating-point variable

---

### 🧠 Memory Visualization

```mermaid
graph TD
A[name = "Shraddha"] --> M1[Memory Address 0x01]
B[age = 23] --> M2[Memory Address 0x02]
C[price = 25.99] --> M3[Memory Address 0x03]
```

Changing value:

```python
age = 24
```

Now `age` still refers to same memory label, but new value `24` replaces old value.

---

### Rules for Naming Variables (Identifiers)

✅ Allowed:

* Alphabets (A–Z, a–z)
* Digits (0–9)
* Underscore `_`

❌ Not Allowed:

* Start with digit
* Special characters (`@, %, $, !`)
* Python keywords (`True`, `False`, `None`, etc.)

📘 **Good practices**

* Meaningful and short names
* Example: `age`, `count`, `user_name`
* Avoid `x1`, `temp_abc` unless necessary

## 🔢 **9. Data Types in Python**

| Data Type  | Description            | Example         |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| `int`      | Whole numbers (±)      | 5, -9, 0        |
| `float`    | Numbers with decimals  | 3.14, -2.5      |
| `str`      | Sequence of characters | `"Hello"`       |
| `bool`     | Boolean values         | `True`, `False` |
| `NoneType` | Represents null/empty  | `None`          |

---

### Checking Type

```python
name = "Shraddha"
age = 23
price = 25.99
print(type(name))   # <class 'str'>
print(type(age))    # <class 'int'>
print(type(price))  # <class 'float'>
```

---

### Strings – `' '`, `" "`, or `''' '''`

```python
s1 = "Python"
s2 = 'Python'
s3 = '''Python'''
```

All valid and equivalent.

---

### Booleans

```python
is_old = False
has_access = True
print(type(is_old))   # <class 'bool'>
```

⚠️ Must be capitalized → `True`, `False`

---

### NoneType

```python
x = None
print(type(x))  # <class 'NoneType'>
```

---

## 🧩 **10. Keywords**

Reserved words in Python with predefined meanings.

Examples:

```
and, or, not, True, False, None, if, else, for, while,
def, return, import, class, break, continue, pass, etc.
```

⚠️ You **cannot** use them as variable names.

---

## 🔠 **11. Case Sensitivity**

Python is **case-sensitive**:

```python
Name = "A"
name = "B"
print(Name)  # A
print(name)  # B
```

These are **different variables**.

---

## ➕ **12. Operators**

### Types of Operators

| Category   | Description                |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| Arithmetic | +, -, *, /, %, **          |
| Relational | ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=       |
| Assignment | =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **= |
| Logical    | and, or, not               |

---

### Arithmetic Operators

```python
a = 5
b = 2
print(a + b)  # 7
print(a - b)  # 3
print(a * b)  # 10
print(a / b)  # 2.5
print(a % b)  # 1 (remainder)
print(a ** b) # 25 (power)
```

---

### Relational Operators

```python
a, b = 50, 20
print(a == b)   # False
print(a != b)   # True
print(a > b)    # True
print(a < b)    # False
print(a >= b)   # True
print(a <= b)   # False
```

Returns **Boolean** (`True` / `False`).

---

### Assignment Operators

```python
num = 10
num += 5  # num = num + 5 → 15
num -= 2  # num = 13
num *= 2  # num = 26
num /= 2  # num = 13.0
```

---

### Logical Operators

| Operator | Meaning           | Example          | Result  |
| -------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| `not`    | Negates a boolean | `not True`       | `False` |
| `and`    | True if both True | `True and False` | `False` |
| `or`     | True if any True  | `True or False`  | `True`  |

---

### Example

```python
a = 50
b = 30
print(a > 40 and b < 40)  # True
print(a < 40 or b < 40)   # True
print(not(a < b))         # True
```

---

## 🔄 **13. Type Conversion**

### 1. Implicit (Automatic)

Python converts types automatically where necessary.

```python
a = 2      # int
b = 4.25   # float
sum = a + b
print(sum)       # 6.25
print(type(sum)) # float
```

Here, `int` → converted to `float` automatically.

---

### 2. Explicit (Type Casting)

Manual conversion using built-in functions:

| Function  | Converts to |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `int()`   | Integer     |
| `float()` | Float       |
| `str()`   | String      |

```python
a = "2"
b = 4.25
a = int(a)
print(a + b)  # 6.25
```

Invalid casting:

```python
a = "Shraddha"
int(a)  # ❌ Error
```

---

## ⌨️ **14. Input Function**

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Welcome", name)
```

Output:

```
Enter your name: Shraddha
Welcome Shraddha
```

All input is **read as a string** by default.

---

### Example – With Numbers

```python
age = input("Enter your age: ")
print(type(age))  # <class 'str'>
```

To convert to int:

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
```

To convert to float:

```python
marks = float(input("Enter marks: "))
```

---

### 🧮 Combined Example

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
marks = float(input("Enter your marks: "))

print("Welcome", name)
print("Your age is", age)
print("Your marks are", marks)
```

---

## 💬 **15. Comments**

Comments are ignored by Python — used for documentation.

### Single-line comment:

```python
# This is a single-line comment
```

### Multi-line comment:

```python
'''
This is
a multi-line
comment
'''
```

Shortcut in VS Code:

* Windows → `Ctrl + /`
* Mac → `Cmd + /`

---

## 🔍 **16. Practice Programs**

### Q1: Input Two Numbers and Print Their Sum

```python
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
print("Sum =", a + b)
```

---

### Q2: Input Side of a Square and Print Its Area

```python
side = float(input("Enter side of square: "))
area = side * side
print("Area =", area)
```

Alternative:

```python
area = side ** 2
```

---

### Q3: Input Two Floating Numbers and Print Their Average

```python
a = float(input("Enter first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter second number: "))
avg = (a + b) / 2
print("Average =", avg)
```

---

### Q4: Input Two Integers a and b, Print True if a ≥ b

```python
a = int(input("Enter a: "))
b = int(input("Enter b: "))
print(a >= b)
```

Output:

```
Enter a: 15
Enter b: 2
True
```
