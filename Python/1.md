## Intuitive Overview: What is Programming?

### The Big Picture Analogy

Imagine you're in a foreign country (France) and need to ask for directions. You can't speak English to the locals - you need to speak French. **Programming is the same concept**: computers don't understand English, Hindi, or any human language naturally. They need **programming languages** like Python.

**The Communication Chain:**
```
You (Human) → Python Code → Computer's Machine Language (0s and 1s) → Action Happens
```

### Why Computers Only Understand 0s and 1s

Think of it like electricity flowing through circuits:
- **1 = High voltage** (electricity flowing)
- **0 = Low voltage** (no electricity)

This is the **only** thing computers fundamentally understand. Everything else is translation!

### The Translator: Python Interpreter

When you write Python code, a special program called an **interpreter** translates it into machine language (0s and 1s) that the computer can execute. Think of it as having a real-time translator when you visit France.

## Why Python for Biomedical AI?

### Python's Superpowers

1. **Simple & Readable**: Code looks almost like English
   ```python
   print("Hello World")  # Even non-programmers understand this!
   ```

2. **Free & Open Source**: No licensing costs, huge community support

3. **High-Level Language**: You don't worry about complex computer details (memory management, hardware control)

4. **Cross-Platform**: Same code runs on Windows, Mac, Linux

5. **AI/ML Powerhouse**: 
   - TensorFlow, PyTorch (deep learning)
   - scikit-learn (machine learning)
   - BioPython (bioinformatics)
   - RDKit (chemistry/drug discovery)
   - pandas/numpy (data manipulation)

### Real-World Biomedical AI Applications (Your Future!)

3. The file explorer on left shows your file structure

---

## Your First Program: Hello World

### The Code

```python
print("Hello World")
```

**What's happening?**
- `print()` is a **function** - a pre-built command that displays text
- `"Hello World"` is a **string** - text enclosed in quotes
- When you run this, "Hello World" appears on screen

### Running Your Code

**In VS Code:**
1. Save your file (Cmd/Ctrl + S)
2. Click the ▶️ play button (top right)
3. See output in terminal below

**What just happened under the hood:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[You wrote: print Hello World] --> B[VS Code saved the .py file]
    B --> C[Python interpreter read your code]
    C --> D[Translated to machine instructions]
    D --> E[Computer displayed: Hello World]
```

## Variables: Storing Information in Memory

### The Mental Model

Think of your computer's memory like a warehouse with thousands of empty boxes (storage locations). A **variable** is like putting a label on a box and storing something inside.

```python
name = "Shraddha"  # Label a box "name", put "Shraddha" inside
age = 23           # Label a box "age", put 23 inside
price = 25.99      # Label a box "price", put 25.99 inside
```

### Visual Representation

```
Computer Memory:
┌─────────────────┐
│ Box: name       │
│ Contents: "Shraddha" │
└─────────────────┘

┌─────────────────┐
│ Box: age        │
│ Contents: 23    │
└─────────────────┘

┌─────────────────┐
│ Box: price      │
│ Contents: 25.99 │
└─────────────────┘
```

### The Assignment Operator `=`

**CRITICAL CONCEPT:** In Python, `=` does NOT mean "equals" (like in math). It means **"assign the value on the right to the variable on the left"**.

```python
age = 23  # Takes 23, stores it in box labeled "age"
```

**Flow of information:**
```
23 ────────────> age
  (value flows from right to left)
```

### Why Variables Matter for AI

In machine learning, you'll constantly store and update values:
```python
learning_rate = 0.001      # Hyperparameter
num_epochs = 100           # Training iterations
model_accuracy = 0.95      # Performance metric
patient_age = 45           # Input feature
tumor_size = 2.3           # Measurement in cm
```

## Data Types: Different Kinds of Information

### The 5 Primary Data Types in Python

Think of data types like different types of containers - you wouldn't store soup in a paper bag or books in a water bottle. Each data type is optimized for specific kinds of information.

#### 1. **Integer (int)** - Whole Numbers

```python
age = 23
count = -5
zero = 0

# Biomedical examples:
patient_count = 150
chromosome_pairs = 23
mutation_position = 1547
```

**Key properties:**
- No decimal points
- Can be positive, negative, or zero
- Used for: counting, indexing, discrete values

#### 2. **Float** - Decimal Numbers

```python
price = 25.99
temperature = 36.5
pi = 3.14159

# Biomedical examples:
drug_concentration = 0.05  # mg/mL
protein_mass = 45.2        # kDa
survival_rate = 0.87       # 87%
tumor_size = 3.2           # cm
```

**Key properties:**
- Has decimal point
- More precise than integers
- Used for: measurements, continuous values, probabilities

#### 3. **String (str)** - Text Data

```python
name = "Shraddha"
gene = "BRCA1"
sequence = "ATCGATCG"
message = "Patient recovered successfully"
```

**Key properties:**
- Enclosed in quotes: `"..."` or `'...'` or `'''...'''`
- Can be single character, word, sentence, or paragraph
- Used for: names, labels, sequences, text data

**Biomedical examples:**
```python
protein_sequence = "MKTAYIAKQRQISFVKSHFSRQ"
diagnosis = "Type 2 Diabetes"
drug_name = "Metformin"
clinical_note = "Patient presented with fever and cough"
```

#### 4. **Boolean (bool)** - True/False Values

```python
is_patient_alive = True
has_diabetes = False
test_positive = True
```

**Key properties:**
- Only TWO possible values: `True` or `False`
- **MUST** capitalize first letter: `True`, not `true`
- Used for: conditions, flags, binary decisions

**Why this matters in AI:**
```python
# Classification outputs
is_cancer = True
is_malignant = False

# Training flags
model_trained = False
convergence_reached = True

# Data quality checks
data_validated = True
missing_values = False
```

#### 5. **None** - No Value

```python
result = None  # Placeholder when no value exists yet
```

**Used when:**
- Variable declared but no value assigned yet
- Function returns nothing
- Missing data indicator

### Checking Data Types: The `type()` Function

```python
name = "Shraddha"
age = 23
price = 25.99
is_old = False

print(type(name))    # Output: <class 'str'>
print(type(age))     # Output: <class 'int'>
print(type(price))   # Output: <class 'float'>
print(type(is_old))  # Output: <class 'bool'>
```

**How to read this:**
- `<class 'str'>` means "this is a string data type"
- `<class 'int'>` means "this is an integer data type"

### Python's Automatic Type Detection

Unlike some languages (Java, C++), Python is **dynamically typed** - it figures out the type automatically:

```python
x = 5        # Python knows this is int
x = 5.0      # Now Python knows this is float
x = "five"   # Now Python knows this is string
```

You never have to explicitly say "this variable is an integer" - Python is smart enough!

## Operators: Performing Operations

### Arithmetic Operators (Math Operations)

Think of these as the calculator buttons:

```python
a = 5
b = 2

# Basic operations
sum = a + b          # 7 (Addition)
difference = a - b   # 3 (Subtraction)
product = a * b      # 10 (Multiplication)
quotient = a / b     # 2.5 (Division - ALWAYS returns float)

# Special operators
remainder = a % b    # 1 (Modulo - remainder after division)
power = a ** b       # 25 (Exponentiation - 5 to the power 2)
```

**Important Note on Division:**
```python
4 / 2   # Result: 2.0 (float, not 2)
```
Even if result is whole number, division ALWAYS returns float in Python!

**Biomedical AI Examples:**
```python
# Calculate drug dosage
patient_weight = 70  # kg
dose_per_kg = 5      # mg/kg
total_dose = patient_weight * dose_per_kg  # 350 mg

# Calculate BMI
weight = 70  # kg
height = 1.75  # meters
bmi = weight / (height ** 2)  # 22.86

# Normalize protein expression levels
expression_level = 850
max_level = 1000
normalized = expression_level / max_level  # 0.85
```

### Comparison Operators (Comparing Values)

These operators check relationships between values and return `True` or `False`:

```python
a = 50
b = 20

print(a == b)   # False (Equal to? NO!)
print(a != b)   # True  (Not equal? YES!)
print(a > b)    # True  (Greater than? YES!)
print(a < b)    # False (Less than? NO!)
print(a >= b)   # True  (Greater than or equal? YES!)
print(a <= b)   # False (Less than or equal? NO!)
```

**CRITICAL:** 
- `=` is assignment (store value)
- `==` is comparison (check equality)

```python
x = 5    # Assignment: store 5 in x
x == 5   # Comparison: is x equal to 5? Returns True
```

**Biomedical Examples:**
```python
glucose_level = 140
normal_threshold = 100

is_diabetic = glucose_level > normal_threshold  # True
needs_medication = is_diabetic == True          # True

tumor_size = 2.5  # cm
operable = tumor_size < 5.0  # True
```

### Logical Operators (Combining Conditions)

These work like human logic - combining multiple True/False statements:

#### 1. `not` - Flips True/False

```python
print(not True)    # False
print(not False)   # True

a = 50
b = 30
print(not (a > b))  # False (because a > b is True, and not True = False)
```

**Think of it as:** "Do the opposite"

#### 2. `and` - Both Must Be True

```python
value1 = True
value2 = True
print(value1 and value2)  # True (both are True)

value1 = True
value2 = False
print(value1 and value2)  # False (one is False)
```

**Truth table:**
```
True  and True  → True
True  and False → False
False and True  → False
False and False → False
```

**Think of it as:** "Both conditions must pass"

**Biomedical Example:**
```python
age = 65
blood_pressure = 140

is_high_risk = (age > 60) and (blood_pressure > 130)  # True
# Patient is high risk ONLY if both conditions are met
```

#### 3. `or` - At Least One Must Be True

```python
value1 = False
value2 = True
print(value1 or value2)  # True (at least one is True)

value1 = False
value2 = False
print(value1 or value2)  # False (both are False)
```

**Truth table:**
```
True  or True  → True
True  or False → True
False or True  → True
False or False → False
```

**Think of it as:** "At least one condition must pass"

**Biomedical Example:**
```python
fever = True
cough = False

has_symptoms = fever or cough  # True
# Patient has symptoms if they have fever OR cough (or both)
```

### Assignment Operators (Shortcuts)

These are abbreviations for common operations:

```python
num = 10

# Long way
num = num + 5   # num becomes 15

# Short way (same thing!)
num += 5        # num becomes 15
```

**All shorthand operators:**
```python
num = 10

num += 5   # Same as: num = num + 5  → Result: 15
num -= 3   # Same as: num = num - 3  → Result: 12
num *= 2   # Same as: num = num * 2  → Result: 24
num /= 4   # Same as: num = num / 4  → Result: 6.0
num %= 3   # Same as: num = num % 3  → Result: 0.0
num **= 2  # Same as: num = num ** 2 → Result: 0.0
```

**Why use these?** Cleaner code, less typing, easier to read

**ML Example:**
```python
learning_rate = 0.01

# Decay learning rate over training
learning_rate *= 0.95  # Multiply by 0.95 each epoch

# Accumulate loss over batches
total_loss = 0
batch_loss = 0.23
total_loss += batch_loss  # Add each batch's loss
```

## Comments: Documenting Your Code

### Why Comments Matter

As your code gets complex (especially in ML/AI), you need to explain:
- What this section does
- Why you chose this approach
- Warnings about edge cases

**Comments are ignored by Python** - they're only for humans reading the code.

### Single-Line Comments

```python
# This is a comment - Python ignores this line
print("Hello")  # This runs, but the comment is ignored

# Calculate drug dosage based on weight
dosage = weight * 5  # 5 mg per kg body weight
```

### Multi-Line Comments

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
Useful for longer explanations.
"""

print("Hello World")
```

### Best Practices for Commenting

**Good comments explain WHY, not WHAT:**
```python
# BAD: Adds 5 to x (obvious from code!)
x = x + 5

# GOOD: Adjust for calibration error in sensor readings
x = x + 5
```

**For AI/ML code:**
```python
# Hyperparameters from grid search on validation set
learning_rate = 0.001  
batch_size = 32

"""
Model Architecture:
- Input: 512 protein features
- Hidden: 2 layers (256, 128 neurons)
- Output: Binary classification (active/inactive)
- Dropout: 0.3 to prevent overfitting
"""
```

**Pro tip:** Comment sections can help future you (or collaborators) understand your thought process!

## Input and Output: Interacting with Users

### Output: The `print()` Function

**Basic usage:**
```python
print("Hello World")  # Output: Hello World
print(23)             # Output: 23
print(3.14)           # Output: 3.14
```

**Printing multiple things:**
```python
name = "Shraddha"
age = 23

# Comma-separated: prints on same line with spaces
print("My name is:", name)         # Output: My name is: Shraddha
print("My age is:", age)           # Output: My age is: 23

# Multiple print statements: each on new line
print("Line 1")
print("Line 2")
# Output:
# Line 1
# Line 2
```

**Printing calculations:**
```python
print(5 + 3)      # Output: 8
print(10 * 2)     # Output: 20
print(15 / 3)     # Output: 5.0
```

### Input: The `input()` Function

**How it works:**
1. Program displays a message
2. Waits for user to type something
3. User presses Enter
4. What they typed gets stored in a variable

**Basic usage:**
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
# Program shows: Enter your name: 
# User types: John
# Now name = "John"

print("Welcome", name)  # Output: Welcome John
```

**CRITICAL CONCEPT: Input Always Returns String!**

```python
age = input("Enter your age: ")
# User types: 25
# age is "25" (string), NOT 25 (integer)

print(type(age))  # Output: <class 'str'>
```

This causes problems in calculations:
```python
age = input("Enter age: ")  # User types: 25
# age is "25" (string)

print(age + 5)  # ERROR! Can't add string and number
```

### Type Casting: Converting Input to Numbers

To use input in calculations, convert string to number:

```python
# Convert to integer
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
# User types: 25
# age is now 25 (integer), not "25" (string)

# Convert to float
weight = float(input("Enter weight in kg: "))
# User types: 70.5
# weight is now 70.5 (float)
```

**Complete example:**
```python
# Input two numbers and calculate sum
first = int(input("Enter first number: "))
second = int(input("Enter second number: "))

sum = first + second
print("Sum =", sum)

# Example run:
# Enter first number: 10
# Enter second number: 20
# Sum = 30
```

### Biomedical Example: BMI Calculator

```python
# Get patient information
name = input("Enter patient name: ")
weight = float(input("Enter weight (kg): "))
height = float(input("Enter height (m): "))

# Calculate BMI
bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

# Display results
print("Patient:", name)
print("BMI:", bmi)

# Example run:
# Enter patient name: John Doe
# Enter weight (kg): 75
# Enter height (m): 1.80
# Patient: John Doe
# BMI: 23.148
```

---

## Type Conversion: Changing Data Types

### Two Types of Conversion

1. **Implicit (Automatic)** - Python does it for you
2. **Explicit (Manual)** - You tell Python to do it

### Implicit Type Conversion (Automatic)

Python automatically converts to "higher" type to avoid data loss:

```python
a = 2      # int
b = 4.25   # float

sum = a + b  # Python converts 2 to 2.0, then adds
print(sum)   # Output: 6.25 (float)
```

**The hierarchy:**
```
int → float → complex
(lower)      (higher)
```

Python always converts to higher type in mixed operations.

### Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting)

When Python can't or won't convert automatically, you do it manually:

#### String to Number

```python
# String containing number
age_str = "23"

# Convert to integer
age_int = int(age_str)
print(type(age_int))  # Output: <class 'int'>

# Convert to float
age_float = float(age_str)
print(type(age_float))  # Output: <class 'float'>
print(age_float)       # Output: 23.0
```

#### Number to String

```python
count = 100
count_str = str(count)
print(type(count_str))  # Output: <class 'str'>
print(count_str)        # Output: "100" (as text)
```

#### Integer to Float

```python
x = 5
x_float = float(x)
print(x_float)  # Output: 5.0
```

#### Float to Integer (Loses Decimal Part!)

```python
price = 25.99
price_int = int(price)
print(price_int)  # Output: 25 (decimal .99 is discarded!)
```

### When Type Casting Fails

Can't convert incompatible types:

```python
name = "Shraddha"
int(name)  # ERROR! Can't convert text to number

number_str = "123"
int(number_str)  # OK! "123" can become 123

mixed = "123abc"
int(mixed)  # ERROR! Contains non-numeric characters
```

**Rule of thumb:** Can only convert if result makes sense (e.g., "42" → 42 works, but "hello" → ??? doesn't)

### Biomedical AI Application

```python
# Reading numeric data from file (comes as strings)
glucose_reading = "140"  # From CSV file
glucose_value = float(glucose_reading)  # Convert for calculation

# Creating labels
is_diabetic = glucose_value > 125
label = str(is_diabetic)  # Convert bool to string for saving

# Processing patient age
age_input = input("Enter age: ")  # String
age = int(age_input)  # Convert for if-conditions

if age > 65:
    print("Senior patient - adjust dosage")
```

---

## Keywords: Python's Reserved Words

### What Are Keywords?

**Keywords** are special words that Python reserves for its own use. You **cannot** use them as variable names.

Think of them like reserved parking spots - they're taken, you can't park there!

**Examples of keywords:**
```
True, False, None, and, or, not, if, else, elif, 
for, while, break, continue, def, class, return, etc.
```

### Why They're Important

```python
# WRONG - Can't use keyword as variable name
True = 5      # ERROR! True is a keyword
for = 10      # ERROR! for is a keyword
if = "test"   # ERROR! if is a keyword

# RIGHT - Use meaningful names instead
is_valid = True
count = 10
condition = "test"
```

### Case Sensitivity in Python

Python is **case-sensitive** - capitalization matters!

```python
# These are ALL DIFFERENT variables:
name = "John"
Name = "Jane"
NAME = "Jack"

print(name)  # John
print(Name)  # Jane
print(NAME)  # Jack
```

**For keywords, capitalization matters:**
```python
True   # Correct (keyword)
true   # ERROR! Not recognized
TRUE   # ERROR! Not recognized

False  # Correct (keyword)
false  # ERROR! Not recognized
```

**Best practice:** 
- Variables: lowercase with underscores: `patient_age`, `gene_name`
- Constants: UPPERCASE: `MAX_DOSE`, `PI`
- Classes (later): CapitalCase: `PatientRecord`, `DrugDatabase`

---

## Variable Naming Rules & Best Practices

### The Rules (Must Follow or Code Won't Run)

1. **Can contain:** Letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), underscore (_)
   ```python
   age_1 = 25        # OK
   patient_2 = "John"  # OK
   _temp = 36.5      # OK
   ```

2. **Cannot start with digit:**
   ```python
   1_variable = 5   # ERROR!
   variable_1 = 5   # OK
   ```

3. **Cannot contain special characters** (@, #, $, %, etc.):
   ```python
   patient@data = 5   # ERROR!
   patient_data = 5   # OK
   ```

4. **Cannot be a keyword:**
   ```python
   for = 10     # ERROR! (for is keyword)
   count = 10   # OK
   ```

5. **Case-sensitive:**
   ```python
   age = 25
   Age = 30
   # These are TWO DIFFERENT variables!
   ```

### Best Practices (Make Code Readable)

**Good variable names are:**
1. **Descriptive** - Say what they store
2. **Concise** - Not too long
3. **Meaningful** - Clear purpose

**Examples:**

```python
# BAD - Not descriptive
x = 70
y = 1.75
z = x / (y * y)

# GOOD - Clear and meaningful
weight_kg = 70
height_m = 1.75
bmi = weight_kg / (height_m ** 2)
```

```python
# BAD - Too cryptic
a = 140
b = 100
c = a > b

# GOOD - Self-documenting
glucose_level = 140
normal_threshold = 100
is_diabetic = glucose_level > normal_threshold
```

**Naming conventions:**
```python
# Snake case (Python standard for variables)
patient_name = "John"
blood_pressure_systolic = 120
drug_concentration_mg_per_ml = 0.5

# Don't mix styles (inconsistent)
PatientName = "John"      # Looks like a class
patient_Name = "John"     # Inconsistent capitalization
```

---

## Character Set: What You Can Type

Python accepts:
- **English letters:** a-z, A-Z
- **Digits:** 0-9
- **Special symbols:** + - * / % ** = == != < > <= >= ( ) [ ] { } : ; , . " ' # @ _
- **Whitespace:** spaces, tabs, newlines
- **Unicode characters** (for strings)

**You cannot use:**
- Letters from other languages (in variable names)
- Most special symbols (except underscore) in variable names

```python
# OK in strings:
protein = "BRCA1遺伝子"  # Unicode characters in string

# NOT OK in variable names:
遺伝子 = "gene"  # ERROR! Non-English characters
```

## Practice Problems: Build Your Skills

### Problem 1: Sum of Two Numbers

**Task:** Input two numbers and print their sum.

**Solution:**
```python
# Get inputs (convert strings to integers)
first = int(input("Enter first number: "))
second = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# Calculate sum
sum = first + second

# Display result
print("Sum =", sum)

# Example run:
# Enter first number: 20
# Enter second number: 50
# Sum = 70
```

**What you learned:**
- Using `input()` to get user data
- Type casting with `int()`
- Basic arithmetic
- Printing results

### Problem 2: Area of a Square

**Task:** Input side of square and print its area.

**Formula:** Area = side × side = side²

**Solution:**
```python
# Get side length (as float for decimal values)
side = float(input("Enter square side: "))

# Calculate area (two ways, both work!)
area = side * side     # Method 1: Multiplication
# area = side ** 2     # Method 2: Exponentiation

# Display result
print("Area =", area)

# Example run:
# Enter square side: 4
# Area = 16.0
```

**Biomedical context:** Calculating cell culture dish area, tissue section area, etc.

### Problem 3: Average of Two Numbers

**Task:** Input two floating-point numbers and print their average.

**Formula:** Average = (num1 + num2) / 2

**Solution:**
```python
# Get two numbers as floats
a = float(input("Enter first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Calculate average
average = (a + b) / 2

# Display result
print("Average =", average)

# Example run:
# Enter first number: 16.5
# Enter second number: 3.5
# Average = 10.0
```

**Biomedical context:** 
- Average of duplicate measurements
- Mean blood pressure (systolic + diastolic) / 2
- Average protein expression across samples

### Problem 4: Comparison Check

**Task:** Input two integers a and b. Print `True` if a ≥ b, otherwise `False`.

**Solution:**
```python
# Get two integers
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# Check condition and print result directly
print(a >= b)  # This expression returns True or False

# Example runs:
# Input: a=15, b=2  → Output: True
# Input: a=2, b=15  → Output: False
```

**What's happening:**
- Expression `a >= b` evaluates to Boolean
- `print()` displays that Boolean value
- No need for if-statement (we'll learn those later!)

**Biomedical context:**
- Checking if patient meets criteria (age ≥ 18)
- Comparing drug efficacy scores
- Threshold-based decisions

## Biomedical AI Applications

### How Today's Concepts Apply to Your Future Work

#### 1. Data Processing Pipelines
```python
# Variables store intermediate results
raw_data = load_patient_records()
cleaned_data = remove_missing_values(raw_data)
normalized_data = normalize_features(cleaned_data)

# Data types matter for different features
patient_id = "PT12345"           # String
age = 45                         # Integer
temperature = 37.2               # Float
has_diabetes = True              # Boolean
previous_surgery = None          # None (no data)
```

#### 2. Model Training
```python
# Hyperparameters (you'll tune these constantly!)
learning_rate = 0.001
batch_size = 32
num_epochs = 100
dropout_rate = 0.3

# Training metrics
current_loss = 0.245
previous_loss = 0.310
improved = current_loss < previous_loss  # True

# Update learning rate (assignment operators)
learning_rate *= 0.95  # Decay by 5%
```

#### 3. Feature Engineering for Protein Data
```python
# Input: protein properties
sequence_length = 350
molecular_weight = 45231.5  # Daltons
charge = -3.2
is_membrane_protein = False

# Calculate features
normalized_weight = molecular_weight / 100000  # Scale down
charge_per_residue = charge / sequence_length

# Comparison-based features
is_large_protein = sequence_length > 500  # Boolean feature
```

#### 4. Clinical Decision Support
```python
# Patient vital signs
heart_rate = int(input("Enter heart rate (bpm): "))
blood_pressure_sys = int(input("Enter systolic BP: "))
temperature = float(input("Enter temperature (°C): "))

# Risk assessment (logical operators)
tachycardia = heart_rate > 100
hypertension = blood_pressure_sys > 140
fever = temperature > 38.0

# Combined risk (you'll use these in if-statements later)
high_risk = (tachycardia and hypertension) or fever
```

#### 5. Genomic Data Processing
```python
# DNA sequence analysis
dna_sequence = "ATCGATCGTAGC"  # String
sequence_length = len(dna_sequence)  # 12

# Type conversions common in bioinformatics
gc_count = "8"  # From file
gc_count_int = int(gc_count)
gc_content = gc_count_int / sequence_length  # 0.666...

print(f"GC content: {gc_content:.2%}")  # "GC content: 66.67%"
```

---

## Common Beginner Pitfalls (And How to Avoid Them!)

### 1. Confusing `=` and `==`

**The Problem:**
```python
# WRONG - Trying to check equality
if x = 5:  # ERROR! This is assignment, not comparison
    print("x is 5")

# RIGHT
if x == 5:  # Comparison - checking if equal
    print("x is 5")
```

**Mental model:**
- `=` → "Store this value" (assignment)
- `==` → "Are these equal?" (comparison)

### 2. Forgetting to Convert Input

**The Problem:**
```python
age = input("Enter age: ")  # User types: 25
# age is "25" (string!)

if age > 18:  # ERROR! Can't compare string to number
    print("Adult")
```

**The Fix:**
```python
age = int(input("Enter age: "))  # Convert to integer
# Now age is 25 (number)

if age > 18:  # Works!
    print("Adult")
```

**Rule:** Always type cast `input()` if you need it as a number!

### 3. Wrong Capitalization of Keywords

**The Problem:**
```python
is_valid = true   # ERROR! Should be True
status = false    # ERROR! Should be False
result = none     # ERROR! Should be None
```

**The Fix:**
```python
is_valid = True   # Correct
status = False    # Correct
result = None     # Correct
```

**Remember:** Boolean keywords MUST have capital first letter!

### 4. Using Keywords as Variable Names

**The Problem:**
```python
for = 10         # ERROR! 'for' is keyword
class = "Math"   # ERROR! 'class' is keyword
if = True        # ERROR! 'if' is keyword
```

**The Fix:**
```python
count = 10           # Use descriptive alternative
course = "Math"      # Use synonym
condition = True     # Use meaningful name
```

### 5. Integer vs Float Division Confusion

**The Problem:**
```python
result = 5 / 2
print(result)     # Prints: 2.5 (float, not 2!)
print(type(result))  # <class 'float'>
```

**What's happening:**
- In Python 3, `/` ALWAYS returns float
- Even if both operands are integers
- Even if result is whole number (4 / 2 = 2.0, not 2)

**If you want integer division:**
```python
result = 5 // 2   # Integer division (floor division)
print(result)     # Prints: 2 (integer, decimal discarded)
```

### 6. Mixing Up Variable Names (Case Sensitivity)

**The Problem:**
```python
patientAge = 25   # Defined with lowercase 'p'
print(PatientAge) # ERROR! Looking for uppercase 'P'
```

**Python sees these as completely different:**
```python
age = 25
Age = 30
AGE = 35
# Three separate variables!
```

**The Fix:** Be consistent with naming:
```python
patient_age = 25        # Define
print(patient_age)      # Use exact same spelling
```

### 7. Trying to Convert Incompatible Types

**The Problem:**
```python
name = "John"
int(name)  # ERROR! Can't convert "John" to integer

mixed = "123abc"
float(mixed)  # ERROR! Contains non-numeric characters
```

**What works:**
```python
number_str = "123"
int(number_str)      # OK: 123

decimal_str = "12.5"
float(decimal_str)   # OK: 12.5

num = 100
str(num)             # OK: "100"
```

**Rule:** Only convert if the result makes logical sense!

### 8. Forgetting Quote Marks for Strings

**The Problem:**
```python
name = John   # ERROR! Python thinks John is a variable
print(Hello)  # ERROR! Python looks for variable Hello
```

**The Fix:**
```python
name = "John"    # String must have quotes
print("Hello")   # String must have quotes
```

**Without quotes, Python thinks it's a variable name!**
