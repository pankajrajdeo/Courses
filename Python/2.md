## üß† Intuitive Overview: Why This Matters for Biomedical AI

### The Real-World Connection

**In biomedical AI, you'll constantly work with:**

1. **Genomic Sequences** (strings of A, T, G, C)
   - Finding mutation sites = string searching
   - Extracting gene regions = string slicing
   - Sequence validation = conditional logic

2. **Clinical Text** (patient notes, reports)
   - Extracting patient age/symptoms = string parsing
   - Classification decisions = conditionals
   - Text preprocessing = string methods

3. **Research Literature** (millions of papers)
   - Keyword extraction = string manipulation
   - Relevance filtering = conditional logic
   - Data cleaning = string methods

**Mental Model:** Think of strings as **biological sequences** or **clinical narratives** that you need to parse, analyze, and make decisions about. Conditionals are your **diagnostic logic** that routes data through different processing pathways.

## üî§ Part 1: Strings - The Text Foundation

### What Are Strings?

A **string** is a data type that stores a sequence of characters‚Äîletters, numbers, symbols, or spaces.

```python
# Three ways to create strings
string1 = "This is a string"        # Double quotes (most common)
string2 = 'Python'                  # Single quotes
string3 = """Multi-line string"""   # Triple quotes (for paragraphs)
```

**Biomedical Example:**
```python
dna_sequence = "ATCGATCGATCG"
patient_name = "John Doe"
diagnosis = "Type 2 Diabetes"
```

---

### Why Three Quote Types?

**Problem:** What if your text contains quotes?

```python
# ‚ùå This breaks - Python gets confused
college = 'Ram's College'  # Syntax error!

# ‚úÖ Solution: Use different outer quotes
college = "Ram's College"  # Works!
quote = 'She said "Hello"'  # Works!
```

**Rule:** Use the quote type that doesn't appear in your text, or use triple quotes for complex text.

---

### Escape Sequences: Formatting Special Characters

**Problem:** How do you add a new line or tab in a string?

**Solution:** Escape sequences‚Äîspecial character codes starting with backslash (`\`)

| Escape Sequence | Meaning | Example |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| `\n` | New line | `"Line 1\nLine 2"` |
| `\t` | Tab space | `"Name:\tJohn"` |
| `\\` | Backslash | `"C:\\Users"` |
| `\"` | Quote | `"He said \"Hi\""` |

```python
string = "This is a string\nWe are creating it in Python"
print(string)
# Output:
# This is a string
# We are creating it in Python

string_tab = "Name:\tJohn\nAge:\t25"
print(string_tab)
# Output:
# Name:    John
# Age:     25
```

**Biomedical Use Case:**
```python
report = "Patient: John Doe\nAge: 45\nDiagnosis: Hypertension\nBP: 140/90"
print(report)
# Formats clinical report with proper line breaks
```

---

### String Operations

#### 1. **Concatenation** (Joining Strings)

Use `+` to combine strings:

```python
str1 = "Apna"
str2 = "College"
final = str1 + " " + str2  # "Apna College"
```

**Biomedical Example:**
```python
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
patient_id = "P12345"

full_record = patient_id + ": " + first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_record)  # "P12345: John Doe"
```

#### 2. **Length** (Counting Characters)

```python
text = "Python"
length = len(text)  # 6
```

**Important:** Spaces, punctuation, and special characters ALL count!

```python
sentence = "Hello World"
print(len(sentence))  # 11 (includes the space!)
```

**Biomedical Example:**
```python
dna = "ATCGATCG"
sequence_length = len(dna)  # 8 base pairs

# Check minimum sequence length for analysis
if len(dna) >= 100:
    print("Sequence long enough for alignment")
```

---

## üî¢ String Indexing: Accessing Individual Characters

**Mental Model:** Think of a string as a **numbered list** where each character has a position.

### Positive Indexing (Left to Right)

```python
text = "PYTHON"
#       012345  ‚Üê index numbers

print(text[0])  # 'P' (first character)
print(text[1])  # 'Y' (second character)
print(text[5])  # 'N' (last character)
```

**Key Rule:** Indexing starts at **0**, not 1!

### Negative Indexing (Right to Left)

```python
text = "PYTHON"
#      -6-5-4-3-2-1  ‚Üê negative indices

print(text[-1])  # 'N' (last character)
print(text[-2])  # 'O' (second from last)
print(text[-6])  # 'P' (first character)
```

**When to use negative indexing:** When you need to access characters from the end without knowing the string length.

**Biomedical Example: DNA Sequence Analysis**
```python
dna = "ATCGATCGATCG"

# Check first base
if dna[0] == "A":
    print("Sequence starts with Adenine")

# Check last base (without knowing length)
if dna[-1] == "G":
    print("Sequence ends with Guanine")

# Check specific position for mutation
position_5 = dna[5]  # Check 6th base (index 5)
if position_5 != "T":
    print("Mutation detected at position 6")
```

### üö´ Important Limitation: Strings Are Immutable

**You CANNOT change characters using indexing:**

```python
text = "HELLO"
text[0] = "J"  # ‚ùå ERROR: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

**To "change" a string, create a new one:**
```python
text = "HELLO"
text = "J" + text[1:]  # ‚úÖ Creates "JELLO"
```

---

## ‚úÇÔ∏è String Slicing: Extracting Subsequences

**Slicing** extracts a portion (substring) from a string.

### Basic Syntax

```python
string[start:end]
# Returns characters from 'start' up to (but NOT including) 'end'
```

**Critical Rule:** The `end` index is **excluded**!

```python
text = "PYTHON"
#       012345

print(text[1:4])   # "YTH" (indices 1, 2, 3 - NOT 4!)
print(text[0:2])   # "PY"  (indices 0, 1)
print(text[2:6])   # "THON" (indices 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

### Visual Guide to Slicing

```python
string = "Apna College"
#         012345678901
#         0         11

string[0:4]   # "Apna" (0,1,2,3)
string[5:12]  # "College" (5,6,7,8,9,10,11)
string[1:4]   # "pna" (1,2,3)
```

### Shorthand Tricks

```python
text = "PYTHON"

# Omit start ‚Üí starts from beginning
text[:3]      # "PYT" (same as text[0:3])

# Omit end ‚Üí goes to the end
text[2:]      # "THON" (same as text[2:6] or text[2:len(text)])

# Both omitted ‚Üí entire string
text[:]       # "PYTHON" (makes a copy)
```

### Negative Slicing

```python
text = "PYTHON"
#      -6-5-4-3-2-1

text[-3:-1]   # "HO" (indices -3, -2, excludes -1)
text[-5:-2]   # "YTH"
text[-4:]     # "THON" (from -4 to end)
```

### üß¨ Biomedical Application: Genomic Sequence Extraction

```python
# Full genomic sequence
genome = "ATCGATCGATCGAAATTTGGGCCCAAATTTGGG"

# Extract specific gene region (bases 10-20)
gene_region = genome[10:20]
print(f"Gene region: {gene_region}")

# Extract promoter region (first 5 bases)
promoter = genome[:5]
print(f"Promoter: {promoter}")

# Extract last 10 bases
terminator = genome[-10:]
print(f"Terminator: {terminator}")

# Extract codon (3 bases at position 15)
start_position = 15
codon = genome[start_position:start_position+3]
print(f"Codon at position {start_position}: {codon}")
```

**Pattern for extracting fixed-length subsequences:**
```python
# Extract n characters starting at position i
subsequence = string[i:i+n]
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Essential String Methods

Methods are **built-in functions** that operate on strings. Think of them as **tools** for text manipulation.

### Method Syntax

```python
string.method_name(arguments)
```

### 1. `endswith()` - Check Ending

**What it does:** Returns `True` if string ends with specified substring, otherwise `False`.

```python
text = "I am studying Python from Apna College"

print(text.endswith("ege"))     # True
print(text.endswith("Python"))  # False (ends with "College")
```

**Biomedical Use:**
```python
filename = "patient_data_2024.csv"

if filename.endswith(".csv"):
    print("Valid CSV file")
    # Process CSV data
    
gene_id = "BRCA1_HUMAN"
if gene_id.endswith("_HUMAN"):
    print("Human gene identified")
```

---

### 2. `capitalize()` - Capitalize First Letter

**What it does:** Returns a new string with the first character capitalized.

```python
text = "python is awesome"
new_text = text.capitalize()
print(new_text)  # "Python is awesome"
```

**Important:** Returns a **new** string; doesn't modify the original!

```python
text = "hello"
text.capitalize()  # Creates new string but doesn't save it
print(text)        # Still "hello"

# To keep the change:
text = text.capitalize()
print(text)        # "Hello"
```

**Biomedical Use:**
```python
# Standardize patient names
patient_name = "john doe"
formatted_name = patient_name.capitalize()  # "John doe"

# Better: use title() for full names
formatted_name = patient_name.title()  # "John Doe"
```

---

### 3. `replace()` - Replace Substrings

**What it does:** Replaces **all occurrences** of old substring with new substring.

```python
text = "I am studying Python from Apna College"

# Replace single character
new_text = text.replace("o", "a")
print(new_text)  # "I am studying Pythan fram Apna Callege"

# Replace word
new_text = text.replace("Python", "JavaScript")
print(new_text)  # "I am studying JavaScript from Apna College"
```

**Biomedical Use:**
```python
# Standardize DNA notation
sequence = "atcgatcg"
standardized = sequence.replace("t", "T").replace("a", "A")
print(standardized)  # "ATCGATCG"

# Clean clinical notes
note = "Patient has HTN and DM"
expanded = note.replace("HTN", "Hypertension").replace("DM", "Diabetes")
print(expanded)  # "Patient has Hypertension and Diabetes"

# Remove unwanted characters
messy_sequence = "ATC-GAT-CG"
clean_sequence = messy_sequence.replace("-", "")
print(clean_sequence)  # "ATCGATCG"
```

---

### 4. `find()` - Search for Substring

**What it does:** Returns the **starting index** of the first occurrence, or `-1` if not found.

```python
text = "I am studying Python from Apna College"

print(text.find("o"))        # 18 (first 'o' in "Python")
print(text.find("Python"))   # 14 (start of word "Python")
print(text.find("q"))        # -1 (not found)
```

**Key Point:** Returns `-1` (not an error!) when substring is not found.

**Biomedical Use:**
```python
# Find mutation site in DNA
dna = "ATCGATCGATCGAAATTTGGG"
mutation_marker = "AAA"

position = dna.find(mutation_marker)
if position != -1:
    print(f"Mutation found at position {position}")
    print(f"Context: {dna[position-5:position+8]}")
else:
    print("No mutation detected")

# Search patient record for keyword
record = "Patient presents with fever, cough, and fatigue"
if record.find("fever") != -1:
    print("Fever symptom detected")
```

---

### 5. `count()` - Count Occurrences

**What it does:** Returns the number of times a substring appears.

```python
text = "I am studying Python from Apna College from home"

print(text.count("from"))  # 2
print(text.count("o"))     # 4 (in Python, from, College, from)
```

**Biomedical Use:**
```python
# Count bases in DNA sequence
dna = "ATCGATCGATCGAAATTTGGG"

adenine_count = dna.count("A")
thymine_count = dna.count("T")
gc_count = dna.count("G") + dna.count("C")

print(f"A: {adenine_count}, T: {thymine_count}")
print(f"GC content: {gc_count / len(dna) * 100:.1f}%")

# Count symptom mentions in clinical notes
notes = "Patient reports headache. Headache persists. Mild headache today."
headache_mentions = notes.lower().count("headache")
print(f"Headache mentioned {headache_mentions} times")
```

---

### üìö More Useful String Methods

```python
# Case conversion
text = "Python Programming"
text.upper()      # "PYTHON PROGRAMMING"
text.lower()      # "python programming"
text.title()      # "Python Programming"

# Whitespace removal
text = "  hello  "
text.strip()      # "hello" (removes leading/trailing spaces)
text.lstrip()     # "hello  " (left only)
text.rstrip()     # "  hello" (right only)

# Checking content
"123".isdigit()   # True (all digits)
"abc".isalpha()   # True (all letters)
"abc123".isalnum() # True (letters or digits)

# Splitting and joining
"a,b,c".split(",")        # ['a', 'b', 'c']
"-".join(['a','b','c'])   # "a-b-c"
```

## üéì Practice: String Problems

### Problem 1: Input Name and Print Length

```python
# Solution
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Length of your name is {len(name)}")

# Example run:
# Enter your name: Shraddha
# Length of your name is 8
```

### Problem 2: Count Dollar Signs

```python
# Solution
string = "Hi I am the $ symbol $$ 99. **Nesting**: Conditionals within conditionals

## üîç Deep Dive: Why These Concepts Matter

### String Processing in Biomedical Context

**1. Genomic Data is Strings**
```python
# Real scenario: Find all start codons in sequence
dna = "ATGATCGATGATGAAATTTGGG"
start_codon = "ATG"

position = 0
start_positions = []

while position < len(dna):
    pos = dna.find(start_codon, position)
    if pos == -1:
        break
    start_positions.append(pos)
    position = pos + 1

print(f"Start codons at positions: {start_positions}")
# Output: [0, 6, 12] - three potential gene starts
```

**2. Clinical Notes are Unstructured Text**
```python
# Real scenario: Extract key information
note = """
Patient: John Doe, 45yo male
CC: Chest pain, SOB
PMH: HTN, DM2
Meds: Metformin 1000mg BID, Lisinopril 10mg daily
"""

# Extract age
age_start = note.find("45yo")
if age_start != -1:
    age = int(note[age_start:age_start+2])
    print(f"Age: {age}")

# Check for diabetes
if "DM2" in note or "diabetes" in note.lower():
    print("Diabetes documented")
```

**3. Research Paper Processing**
```python
# Real scenario: Filter relevant papers
abstract = """
We investigated the efficacy of Drug-X in treating 
COVID-19 patients. Results showed 45% reduction in 
hospitalization rates (p<0.001).
"""

# Check if paper is relevant to your research
keywords = ["COVID-19", "drug efficacy", "hospitalization"]
relevance_score = sum(1 for kw in keywords if kw.lower() in abstract.lower())

if relevance_score >= 2:
    print(f"Highly relevant paper (score: {relevance_score}/3)")
    
    # Extract p-value
    p_pos = abstract.find("p<")
    if p_pos != -1:
        p_value_str = abstract[p_pos+2:p_pos+7]
        print(f"Significance: p<{p_value_str}")
```

---

### Conditionals: The Logic of Medicine

**Medicine is inherently conditional:**
- "**If** temperature > 100.4¬∞F **and** patient is immunocompromised, **then** start broad-spectrum antibiotics"
- "**If** troponin elevated **and** ECG shows ST changes, **then** suspect MI"
- "**If** patient age > 50 **and** family history positive, **then** increase screening frequency"

**Your code will encode clinical decision rules:**

```python
# Real clinical decision support system (simplified)
def assess_sepsis_risk(temp, heart_rate, wbc_count, blood_pressure):
    """
    SIRS criteria for sepsis screening
    """
    sirs_criteria = 0
    
    # Temperature criterion
    if temp > 38 or temp < 36:
        sirs_criteria += 1
        
    # Heart rate criterion
    if heart_rate > 90:
        sirs_criteria += 1
        
    # WBC criterion
    if wbc_count > 12000 or wbc_count < 4000:
        sirs_criteria += 1
        
    # Respiratory rate would be checked here...
    
    if sirs_criteria >= 2:
        if blood_pressure < 90:
            return "SEPTIC SHOCK - IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION"
        else:
            return "SEPSIS - URGENT EVALUATION"
    else:
        return "Monitor for infection"

# Example usage
result = assess_sepsis_risk(
    temp=39.2,           # High fever
    heart_rate=105,      # Tachycardic
    wbc_count=15000,     # Elevated WBC
    blood_pressure=110   # BP okay
)
print(result)  # "SEPSIS - URGENT EVALUATION"
```

## üß™ Advanced String Techniques (Preview)

### Regular Expressions (Coming Soon)

While basic string methods work for simple patterns, **regular expressions** handle complex patterns:

```python
import re

# Extract all email addresses from text
text = "Contact: john@hospital.org or jane@clinic.com"
emails = re.findall(r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b', text)
# ['john@hospital.org', 'jane@clinic.com']

# Extract all patient IDs (pattern: P followed by 6 digits)
notes = "Patient P123456 and P789012 were seen today"
patient_ids = re.findall(r'P\d{6}', notes)
# ['P123456', 'P789012']

# Validate phone numbers
phone = "(555) 123-4567"
if re.match(r'\(\d{3}\) \d{3}-\d{4}', phone):
    print("Valid phone format")
```

**When you need regex:** 
- Complex patterns (emails, phone numbers, medical record numbers)
- Flexible matching (date formats, measurement units)
- Data validation (structured fields)

---

## üé® Code Style: Indentation Deep Dive

### Why Python Uses Indentation

**Other languages** (Java, C++, JavaScript):
```java
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("Can vote");
    System.out.println("Can drive");
}
```

**Python** (cleaner, more readable):
```python
if age >= 18:
    print("Can vote")
    print("Can drive")
```

**The rule:** All code at the same indentation level belongs together.

```python
if condition:
    # These are all part of the 'if' block
    statement1
    statement2
    statement3
# This is OUTSIDE the 'if' block (back to original level)
always_runs
```

### Indentation Errors to Watch For

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG - Inconsistent indentation
if age >= 18:
    print("Can vote")
      print("Can drive")  # Extra spaces - Error!

# ‚ùå WRONG - Missing indentation
if age >= 18:
print("Can vote")  # Not indented - Error!

# ‚ùå WRONG - Unexpected indentation
x = 5
    y = 10  # Why is this indented? - Error!

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Consistent 4-space indentation
if age >= 18:
    print("Can vote")
    print("Can drive")
    if has_license:
        print("Can drive alone")
```

**Pro tip:** Configure your editor to show invisible characters (spaces, tabs) to catch indentation issues.

## üéØ Key Patterns to Remember

### Pattern 1: Range Checking
```python
# Checking if value is in a range
if 18 <= age <= 65:
    # Equivalent to: age >= 18 and age <= 65
    print("Working age")
```

### Pattern 2: Membership Testing
```python
# Check if item is in a collection
valid_bases = "ATCG"
if base in valid_bases:
    print("Valid DNA base")

# Multiple options
if status in ["active", "pending", "review"]:
    print("In progress")
```

### Pattern 3: Default Values with Else
```python
# Always have a fallback
if condition1:
    result = "Option A"
elif condition2:
    result = "Option B"
else:
    result = "Default"  # Always defined
```

### Pattern 4: Early Exit (Guard Clauses)
```python
# Check invalid conditions first
if len(sequence) < 10:
    print("Error: Sequence too short")
    # exit or return here
elif not sequence:
    print("Error: Empty sequence")
    # exit or return here
else:
    # Main processing here
    process_sequence(sequence)
```

## üíé Final Thoughts: The Mindset

### Don't Memorize‚ÄîUnderstand Patterns

You don't need to memorize every string method. You need to understand:
- "I need to search for text" ‚Üí `find()` or `in`
- "I need to count occurrences" ‚Üí `count()`
- "I need to change text" ‚Üí `replace()`
- "I need to make a decision" ‚Üí `if/elif/else`

**When you forget syntax:** Google is your friend. Even experienced developers look up syntax daily.

**What matters:** Understanding the logic and patterns.

### Practice With Real Problems

Don't just do toy examples. Work with real biomedical scenarios:
- Download a sample DNA sequence (NCBI database)
- Find a clinical note template and parse it
- Process a list of patient records (anonymized)
- Build a simple symptom checker

### Code Every Day

**Better:** 30 minutes daily
**Worse:** 5 hours once a week

Consistency builds intuition. Your brain needs time to internalize patterns.

## üìñ Quick Reference Card

### String Operations
```python
s = "Hello World"
len(s)              # 11 - length
s[0]                # 'H' - first char
s[-1]               # 'd' - last char
s[0:5]              # "Hello" - slice
s.find("World")     # 6 - position
s.count("l")        # 3 - occurrences
s.replace("o", "0") # "Hell0 W0rld"
s.upper()           # "HELLO WORLD"
s.lower()           # "hello world"
s.strip()           # Remove whitespace
"x" in s            # False - membership
```

### Conditionals
```python
if condition:
    code
elif condition:
    code
else:
    code

# Comparisons: == != > < >= <=
# Logical: and or not
# Ranges: 10 <= x <= 20
# Membership: x in [1,2,3]
```

**Next Up:** Loops (for, while) - automating repetitive tasks for large-scale data processing! üîÑ99"
dollar_count = string.count("$")
print(dollar_count)  # Output: 3
```

---

## üîÄ Part 2: Conditional Statements - Decision Logic

### The Foundation of All Algorithms

**Mental Model:** Conditionals are **decision trees** that route your program down different paths based on conditions.

In biomedical AI:
- **Diagnostic algorithms**: If symptoms X and Y, then diagnosis Z
- **Data filtering**: If age > 18, include in adult cohort
- **Quality control**: If sequence length < 100, reject sample

---

### Basic Syntax

```python
if condition:
    # Code runs if condition is True
    statement1
    statement2
```

**Key Rules:**
1. Condition must evaluate to `True` or `False`
2. Colon `:` is required after condition
3. **Indentation** (4 spaces or 1 tab) is MANDATORY
4. All indented code runs together when condition is True

---

### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `==` | Equal to | `x == 5` |
| `!=` | Not equal to | `x != 5` |
| `>` | Greater than | `x > 5` |
| `<` | Less than | `x < 5` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal | `x >= 5` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal | `x <= 5` |

---

### Example 1: Simple If Statement

```python
age = 21

if age >= 18:
    print("Can vote")
    print("Can apply for license")

# Output (age=21):
# Can vote
# Can apply for license

# Output (age=16):
# (nothing printed)
```

---

### `elif` - Multiple Conditions

**Read as:** "else if" - checks another condition if previous was False.

```python
light = "green"

if light == "red":
    print("Stop")
elif light == "green":
    print("Go")
elif light == "yellow":
    print("Wait")

print("End of code")
```

**How it works:**
1. Check `if light == "red"` ‚Üí False, skip
2. Check `elif light == "green"` ‚Üí **True**, execute and STOP
3. Skip remaining elif blocks
4. Continue with code after all conditions

**Key Difference: `if` vs `elif`**

```python
num = 5

# Using 'if' - BOTH execute
if num > 2:
    print("Greater than 2")  # Executes
if num > 3:
    print("Greater than 3")  # Also executes

# Using 'elif' - ONLY FIRST executes
if num > 2:
    print("Greater than 2")  # Executes
elif num > 3:
    print("Greater than 3")  # Skipped!
```

---

### `else` - The Catch-All

**Read as:** "Otherwise" - runs if ALL previous conditions were False.

```python
age = 16

if age >= 18:
    print("Can vote")
else:
    print("Cannot vote")

# Output: Cannot vote
```

**Complete Structure:**

```python
if condition1:
    # Runs if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Runs if condition1 is False AND condition2 is True
elif condition3:
    # Runs if condition1 and condition2 are False AND condition3 is True
else:
    # Runs if ALL above conditions are False
```

---

### Logical Operators: Combining Conditions

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `and` | Both must be True | `age >= 18 and age < 65` |
| `or` | At least one must be True | `x == 5 or x == 10` |
| `not` | Inverts True/False | `not (x > 5)` |

**Truth Tables:**

```python
# AND - both must be True
True and True   ‚Üí True
True and False  ‚Üí False
False and True  ‚Üí False
False and False ‚Üí False

# OR - at least one must be True
True or True    ‚Üí True
True or False   ‚Üí True
False or True   ‚Üí True
False or False  ‚Üí False

# NOT - inverts
not True  ‚Üí False
not False ‚Üí True
```

---

### üß¨ Biomedical Example: Grading System

```python
marks = int(input("Enter student marks: "))

if marks >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif marks >= 80 and marks < 90:
    grade = "B"
elif marks >= 70 and marks < 80:
    grade = "C"
else:
    grade = "D"

print(f"Grade of the student is {grade}")

# Example runs:
# marks=94 ‚Üí A
# marks=88 ‚Üí B
# marks=67 ‚Üí D
```

**Cleaner version using comparisons:**

```python
if marks >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif marks >= 80:  # No need for "and marks < 90"
    grade = "B"     # Already know marks < 90 from previous check
elif marks >= 70:
    grade = "C"
else:
    grade = "D"
```

---

### ü©∫ Clinical Application: Patient Eligibility

```python
age = int(input("Enter patient age: "))
has_symptoms = input("Has symptoms? (yes/no): ").lower()

if age >= 18 and age <= 80:
    if has_symptoms == "yes":
        print("‚úÖ Eligible for clinical trial")
        print("Schedule screening appointment")
    else:
        print("‚ùå No symptoms - not eligible")
else:
    print("‚ùå Age outside eligible range (18-80)")

# Example 1: age=45, symptoms=yes ‚Üí Eligible
# Example 2: age=85, symptoms=yes ‚Üí Age outside range
# Example 3: age=30, symptoms=no ‚Üí No symptoms
```

---

### Nested Conditionals

**Nesting** means putting one if statement inside another.

```python
age = 95

if age >= 18:
    print("Can drive")
    
    if age >= 80:  # Nested inside first if
        print("Cannot drive")
    else:
        print("Can drive")  # This is for age 18-79
else:
    print("Cannot drive")  # Under 18
```

**When to use nesting:** When you need to check a second condition ONLY if the first is True.

---

## üéØ Practice: Conditional Problems

### Problem 1: Check Odd or Even

```python
num = int(input("Enter number: "))

if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")

# Examples:
# 14 ‚Üí Even
# 17 ‚Üí Odd
```

**Logic:** Even numbers divide by 2 with remainder 0.

---

### Problem 2: Find Greatest of Three Numbers

```python
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
c = int(input("Enter third number: "))

if a >= b and a >= c:
    print(f"First is largest: {a}")
elif b >= c:
    print(f"Second is largest: {b}")
else:
    print(f"Third is largest: {c}")

# Examples:
# 4, 5, 7 ‚Üí Third is largest: 7
# 99, 201, 87 ‚Üí Second is largest: 201
```

---

### Problem 3: Check Multiple of 7

```python
x = int(input("Enter number: "))

if x % 7 == 0:
    print("Multiple of 7")
else:
    print("Not a multiple")

# Examples:
# 21 ‚Üí Multiple of 7
# 16 ‚Üí Not a multiple
```

**Logic:** Any multiple of N has remainder 0 when divided by N.

## üî¨ Biomedical AI Applications

### 1. DNA Sequence Validation

```python
dna_sequence = input("Enter DNA sequence: ")

# Check valid bases
valid = True
for base in dna_sequence:
    if base not in "ATCG":
        valid = False
        break

if valid and len(dna_sequence) >= 10:
    print("‚úÖ Valid DNA sequence")
    
    # Count GC content
    gc_count = dna_sequence.count("G") + dna_sequence.count("C")
    gc_percentage = (gc_count / len(dna_sequence)) * 100
    
    if gc_percentage > 60:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è High GC content: {gc_percentage:.1f}%")
    else:
        print(f"GC content: {gc_percentage:.1f}%")
else:
    print("‚ùå Invalid sequence")
```

### 2. Patient Risk Stratification

```python
age = int(input("Patient age: "))
blood_pressure = int(input("Systolic BP: "))
cholesterol = int(input("Cholesterol: "))

risk_score = 0

# Age factor
if age >= 65:
    risk_score += 2
elif age >= 45:
    risk_score += 1

# BP factor
if blood_pressure >= 140:
    risk_score += 2
elif blood_pressure >= 120:
    risk_score += 1

# Cholesterol factor
if cholesterol >= 240:
    risk_score += 2
elif cholesterol >= 200:
    risk_score += 1

# Risk assessment
if risk_score >= 5:
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH RISK - Immediate intervention needed")
elif risk_score >= 3:
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è MODERATE RISK - Close monitoring")
else:
    print("‚úÖ LOW RISK - Continue routine care")

print(f"Risk score: {risk_score}/6")
```

---

### 3. Clinical Text Processing

```python
clinical_note = input("Enter clinical note: ")

# Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive search
note_lower = clinical_note.lower()

# Keyword detection
symptoms = []

if "fever" in note_lower:
    symptoms.append("Fever")
if "cough" in note_lower:
    symptoms.append("Cough")
if "fatigue" in note_lower:
    symptoms.append("Fatigue")
if "headache" in note_lower:
    symptoms.append("Headache")

if len(symptoms) > 0:
    print(f"Symptoms detected: {', '.join(symptoms)}")
    
    # Severity assessment
    if len(symptoms) >= 3:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple symptoms - Consider comprehensive workup")
    else:
        print("Monitor symptoms")
else:
    print("No common symptoms detected")
```

## üö® Common Beginner Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. **Forgetting Indentation**

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG
if age >= 18:
print("Can vote")  # IndentationError!

# ‚úÖ CORRECT
if age >= 18:
    print("Can vote")
```

### 2. **Using = Instead of ==**

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG (assignment, not comparison)
if age = 18:  # SyntaxError!

# ‚úÖ CORRECT
if age == 18:
```

### 3. **Forgetting Colon**

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG
if age >= 18  # SyntaxError!
    print("Can vote")

# ‚úÖ CORRECT
if age >= 18:
    print("Can vote")
```

### 4. **Confusing String and Number Comparison**

```python
age = input("Enter age: ")  # Returns STRING!

# ‚ùå WRONG
if age >= 18:  # Comparing string to number!

# ‚úÖ CORRECT
age = int(input("Enter age: "))
if age >= 18:
```

### 5. **Incorrect Range Checks**

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG (Python can't read your mind)
if 80 <= marks < 90:  # Seems right but confusing

# ‚úÖ CLEAREST
if marks >= 80 and marks < 90:

# ‚úÖ PYTHONIC (actually works in Python!)
if 80 <= marks < 90:  # This IS valid in Python!
```

---

## üí° Best Practices for Biomedical AI Code

### 1. **Validate Input Data**

```python
# Always check data before processing
sequence = input("Enter DNA: ")

if not sequence:
    print("Error: Empty sequence")
elif len(sequence) < 10:
    print("Error: Sequence too short")
elif not all(base in "ATCG" for base in sequence):
    print("Error: Invalid bases")
else:
    # Process valid sequence
    print("Processing...")
```

### 2. **Use Descriptive Variable Names**

```python
# ‚ùå BAD
if x > 18 and y < 140:
    z = "low"

# ‚úÖ GOOD
if patient_age > 18 and systolic_bp < 140:
    risk_level = "low"
```

### 3. **Comment Complex Logic**

```python
# Check if patient meets trial inclusion criteria
if (age >= 18 and age <= 65 and           # Age range
    not has_prior_treatment and            # Treatment-naive
    egfr_score >= 60):                     # Kidney function OK
    
    eligible = True
```

### 4. **Use String Methods for Robustness**

```python
# Handle case variations
user_input = input("Continue? (yes/no): ")

# ‚ùå FRAGILE
if user_input == "yes":

# ‚úÖ ROBUST
if user_input.lower().strip() == "yes":
    # Handles "Yes", "YES", " yes ", etc.
```
